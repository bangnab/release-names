Animal release names
======
This is just a fun little script to generate random release names based on animals names and non-negative adjectives. Currently this is able to generate more than 100'000 different release names.

## Usage
Simply run the `generate_release_name` bash script to get a random name in the standard output:
```
$ ./generate_release_name 
living_hawk
```
